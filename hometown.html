    <p>
        Tangerang is a city in the province of Banten, Indonesia. Located on the western border of Jakarta, it is the third largest urban centre in the Greater Jakarta metropolitan area after Jakarta and Bekasi; the sixth largest city proper in the nation; and the largest city in Banten province. It has an area of 164.54 square kilometres (63.53 square miles) and an official 2010 Census population of 1,798,601, which had risen to 2,043,213 at the 2015 Intermediate Census. The latest official estimate as at mid 2020 is 2,273,697 – making it the eighth most populated suburb in the world at the latter date.
        Tangerang, along with the neighbouring South Tangerang, is where many giant developers created built-up areas such as BSD City, Gading Serpong, Alam Sutera, and Lippo Village.
        Tangerang is home for Soekarno–Hatta International Airport which serves the Jakarta metropolitan area and is Indonesia's main gateway.

            Tangerang has a significant community of Chinese Indonesians, many of whom are of Cina Benteng extraction. They are part of the country's Peranakan Chinese community, but with deep, centuries-old roots in the historic Tangerang area, also called 'Benteng' locally.
            Most of the old settlements in Tangerang have colonial, Chinese districts, such as at Sewan, Pasar Lama, Pasar Baru, Benteng Makasar, Kapling and Karawaci Lama (the precursor to Lippo Karawaci). One can find any food and all things Chinese there.In addition, a large proportion of Benteng Chinese have traditionally been rural dwellers, engaged in agricultural activities, such as farming and livestock production.
            Due to the growth of satellite towns in the greater Jakarta region, which includes Tangerang, the area is now home to many new migrants from all parts of Indonesia
