                 An Aspiring Data Scientist
             </h3>

             <p>
               My name is Joseph Eric Amadeo Seloatmodjo. I'm an informatic student at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) Surabaya.
                I love Machine Learning. I'm currently focused on Deep Learning method. 
                 It's a subset of machine learning which utilizes a hierarchical level of artificial neural networks to carry out the process of machine learning. The artificial neural networks are built like the human brain, with neuron nodes connected together like a web.I think its 
                 very interesting and have a great potential to solve a lot of problems in our life.

             </p>
             <p>
                I want to be a data scientist after graduating. Data scientists are big data wranglers, gathering and analyzing large sets of structured and unstructured data. A data scientist’s role combines computer science, statistics, and mathematics. They analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and other organizations.

                Data scientists are analytical experts who utilize their skills in both technology and social science to find trends and manage data. They use industry knowledge, contextual understanding, skepticism of existing assumptions – to uncover solutions to business challenges.

            <p>
               Ever since introduced to pc gaming, i can't stop playing. I've played multiplayer games like Dota 2, Valorant, and PUBG, as well as single-player game like Skyrim, GTA Series, Portal, and many more.
               My favourite game of all time is Dishonored. It's a single player game that tells the story of Corvo Attano, bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles. He is framed for her murder and forced to become an assassin, seeking revenge on those who conspired against him.
               The game offer many ways to complete it, and it's very fun to play.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want to play with me, please add me on Steam. I'm currently playing Dota 2, and in need of friends to play with. Note: I'm on South East Asia server.
